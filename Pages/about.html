      <h1>About Keabatho's Fast Food</h1>
        <p>Learn more about our story, mission, and the people behind the brand.</p>
      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>
        KeaBatho's Fast Food was founded with a dream to bring high-quality, tasty, 
        and affordable meals to our community. 
        It all started in 2018, when our founder noticed that many fast food options 
        lacked the warmth and personal touch that make dining a joyful experience. 
        From a small kitchen serving a handful of customers daily, KeaBatho's Fast Food has grown into 
        a bustling eatery beloved by families, students, and professionals alike. 
        Every dish we create reflects our commitment to freshness, flavor, and customer satisfaction. 
        Our story is one of passion, perseverance, and the belief that good food has the power to bring people together, 
        whether it's for a quick lunch break or a family outing. Over the years, we've expanded our menu to 
        include a variety of options that cater to all tastes, while staying true to our roots of providing fast, 
        friendly, and flavorful service.
