      <h1>About Keabatho's Fast Food</h1>
      <h5>Learn more about our story, mission, and the people behind the brand.</h5>
      <p>
        KeaBatho's Fast Food was founded with a dream to bring high-quality, tasty, 
        and affordable meals to our community. It all started in 2018, when our founder 
        noticed that many fast food options lacked the warmth and personal touch that 
        make dining a joyful experience. From a small kitchen serving a handful of 
        customers daily, KeaBatho's Fast Food has grown into a bustling eatery beloved 
        by families, students, and professionals alike.
      </p>
      <p class="gray">
        Every dish we create reflects our commitment to freshness, flavor, and customer satisfaction. 
        Our story is one of passion, perseverance, and the belief that good food has the power to 
        bring people together, whether it's for a quick lunch break or a family outing. Over the years, 
        we've expanded our menu to include a variety of options that cater to all tastes, while staying 
        true to our roots of providing fast, friendly, and flavorful service.
